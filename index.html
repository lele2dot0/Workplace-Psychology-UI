						    <p class="text-center">“You are unlikely to have met anyone like her before.  She is incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about her craft of educating and developing people, at all levels including senior leaders.  She brings a mindset of excellence and growth to everything she does, and she expects it in those she develops.  She overlays the technical learning and content she presents with commercialism and client-centricity, which ensures relevance and impact. She has deep knowledge across a vast array of topics and material, which means she can assist people to understand the learning more deeply. She is great fun to boot!</p>
						    <p>I had the privilege of collaborating with Carolann in the design of some key leadership and development programs. Her openness in collaboration, understanding of our needs, areas of focus, and ability to draw on her vast experience, meant that our firm came away with a product which had great depth. The programme was nuanced and had real impact for those undertaking the development. I knew of Carolann’s reputation for the design and delivery of a globally leading offering long before I met her, and I was not disappointed."</p>

							<p class="text-center">“My engagement with Carolann began at a time in my career when I was in a middle-management leadership role in an organisation where I was managing and experiencing significant change. It only took a very short period of time working with Carolann to find that I had the skills and confidence to move into a more senior position in a new organisation, and over a period of 5 years of working with her I have been promoted three times. Carolann’s coaching has truly been life-changing for me..”</p>

I found Carolann’s mentoring sessions and the CSP invaluable, in particular: Carolann taught me a huge amount about developing my personal brand and how to network effectively; she provided guidance on how to understand the financial side of growing my legal practice; and she instilled in me confidence to achieve my goals.”</p>
